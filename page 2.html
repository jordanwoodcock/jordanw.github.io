<h2>PARTY TIME!</h2>
<p>We’re back from the incredible StarLadder Berlin Major. While the teams were busy with record-breaking 60-round matches, the community was busy as well: tournament items for this major will pay out over $11 million for participating teams and players!

During the Major, we followed conversations in the community about leagues, media rights, and the future of CS:GO events. And while we typically don’t weigh in on these conversations, there are a few issues we want to clarify to make sure everyone is on the same page.</p>

<p>Once your account is flagged for the new Party system, your game will automatically sync with your Steam Friends List information and allow you to create a party via PsyNet. You’ll still use the 'Create Party' button as you normally would, but instead of seeing a Party invite in Steam, you’ll see new in-game notifications alerting you to a Party invite.</p>

<p>While the PsyNet Party System is Steam-only, this is the first step in enabling the possibility of supporting cross-platform parties at a later date. We’ll have more information about the new Party System once we’re closer to launch.</p>

<h2>EVENTS COMING SOON</h2>
<p>As detailed on our Autumn Update page, we are also debuting a new 'Events' system, which introduces limited-time events that provide players with the opportunity to earn additional car customizations. Using a new item called the 'Decryptor,’ (obtained as drops after online matches) players will be able to unlock any unopened Crate in their inventory without having to purchase a Key. Additional information will be provided closer to the launch of the events themselves later this year.</p>
<p>his event will become a milestone in ESL history as we bring the best CS:GO teams in the world to China on a larger scale than ever before.

IEM Chengdu 2009 was our first tournament in the country and since then we have successfully executed 11 tournaments, IEM Beijing 2019 will be our 12th.

We are excited to jump into a new arena and show one of the most passionate regions in esports the full ESL event experience.</p>
